# blockchain-cryptocurrency-project

This basic application has been developed for term project of Security of Software Systems lecture. 

In order to see transactions (transferred Test/Free Ethereum) I used Metamask and Etherscan. 

This application helped me to have basic understanding of the intricacies and importance of encryption, blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts as well as in which areas and for what purposes it can be used.
